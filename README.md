# ShortcutDemo

Small Repo to explore how to implement shortcuts and a command palette using phoenix live view.


## Inspiration

- https://launchscout.com/blog/key-combination-events-with-phoenix-liveview
- https://github.com/elixir-saas/command_k/blob/master/lib/command_k.ex
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent

## TODO

- refactor global state to be in its own live_component. It can then easily be shared between pages.
